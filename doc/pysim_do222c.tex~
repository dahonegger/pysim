\section{Introduction}

In assessning numerical modeles againts observations one needs to consider at
least two source of errors. the first group is the one assosciated with
bathymetry, boundary conditions and forcings and the next is the
errors arises because of shorcomings in description of physical processes in
terms of governing equations and internal definition in models which will be
referd as input error and  process error hereafter.




\section{Methodology}

Here we describe a methodology for assimilating observational data and improving
available bathymetry survay based on availble grided and point observations of
wave and current parameters in an tidal inlet.
The method consists of below mentioned steps:


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Generating a set of \textit{N} ensemble bathymetry members based on
  perior knowledeg and related uncertainities.
  \item Apply modeling system (hydrodynamic and wave model) to each of
  the ensemble members.
  \item Compute the mean and covariance matrices from modeled members.
  \item 
   
  \item 
    
\item 
\end{enumerate}

assume:
\begin{align}
h=h^t+p
\end{align}

where $h^t$ is the true bathymetry. $p$ is its associated error. The resulted
prediction $v$ is:

\begin{align}
v=G \left( h^t+p \right )=v^t+q.
\end{align}

The goal is to reach to an optimal estimate of the true state on the model grid,
$v^t=G\left( h^t \right )$, taking into acount availble obseravations as:
\begin{align}
d=L \, v^t+ \varepsilon.
\end{align}
where $\varepsilon$ is the observation error and $L$ is a measurments
operator.
