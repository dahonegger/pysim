    \section{Introduction}
    My primary research interest is the development of state-of-the-art numerical
    tools using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques and applying these
    tools to flow hydrodynamics, environmental fluid dynamics and transport
    processes in coastal and shelf seas. The purpose of this research is to gain
    insight into the physics of such phenomena and accordingly make practical 
    and accurate predictions of these environments. I am also interested in
    experimental and field study involving phenomena shaping hydrodynamics of coastal systems.       
    In this statement, I will first present my past and current research, followed
    by my future research plans and philosophy. Finally, I will conclude with a
    summarization of my research statement.     
    
    \section{Past Research}
    Numerical modeling is playing an increasingly important role in coastal and
    ocean science. To date however; developing, validating and
    ultimately employing numerical methods to simulate hydrodynamics of complicated
    dynamical environments, such as shallow coastal waters and estuaries, remain 
    challenging issues. My research interest during the last ten years contributes
    to this endeavor by focusing on the development of numerical codes, and
    by verifying and applying developed models to challenging Lab and real world
    cases.
    
    The main focus of my PhD research (2000$-$2005) was to develop a comprehensive
    dynamically coupled modeling system, including a three-dimensional hydrodynamic 
    model and a third generation surface wave model, in order to investigate
    bilateral effects of storm surge and surface waves in shallow coastal regions. I further developed
    this modeling system to include the effect of wave-current interaction inside
    the bottom boundary layer (BBL) using different wave-current BBL definitions.      
    
    I applied this modeling system in a highly variable tidal environment in the
    Wadden Sea area during my visit to the Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht research
    center in 2004. I further investigated effects of locally generated wind
    waves and incoming swells from the North Sea on the distribution of friction
    velocity, especially at the entrance of the inlet, as well as in extremely
    shallow parts inside the tidal flat. In order to validate the modeling system, I
    compared both wave and hydrodynamic modeling results with available measurements
    from deployed tower and number of wave buoys, and with ADCP observations in the
    region. The scientific achievements of my PhD research was published as a
    full length research paper in Ocean Dynamics and was presented in several
    scientific conferences.
    
    After graduation in 2005, I was appointed as an assistant professor in the Civil
    Engineering Department at the Arak University, Arak, Iran, where I initiated
    other leading-edge research studies. I initiated the first meteo-ocean prediction
    system for the Iranian Office of Meteorology as a national project. During this
    project I converted my developed modeling system to an efficient parallel
    computing program, including all necessary pre- and post-processing and
    verification packages. I further employed a variety of numerical modeling
    frameworks in different research projects to investigate thermal pollution and
    contaminate transport in coastal and lake environments.         
    
    After I was awarded the Alexander von Humboldt fellowship in 2009, I 
    continued this line of research by joining the Coastal Ocean and Physical
    Process Studies Group at the Department of Physical Oceanography of the Leibniz
    Institute for Baltic Sea Research. This group has and continues to develop 
    leading edge open source Ocean models, including The General Ocean Turbulence
     Model (GOTM), which is one of the most well known ocean turbulence
    models, and the General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM), a 3D coastal ocean
    model.
    
    During my fellowship I concentrated on and achieved three crucial goals: (1)
    develop and couple a spectral wind wave model to GETM in a flexible manner, with
    regard to the possibility for massive MPI runs on supercomputers, (2)
    implement the most recent wave-current interaction physics with a wide range of
    oceanic applications, and (3) study the effects of injecting wave
    dissipated energy on local mixing properties of the ocean water column. 
    I have further implemented mechanisems regarding the effects of surface waves in
    deep and shallow parts of the ocean contributing to momentum and energy exchange 
    between atmosphere and ocean. One of the main concerns of this research was
    implementation of the Vortex Force (VF) concept as the main driving force, 
    together with the Generalized Lagrangian Method (GLM).       
     
    As a research fellow, I used state-of-the-art parallel programming tools to
    create a coupled wave and circulation modeling framework, which includes the
    latest published physical interaction mechanisms (e.g. turbulence effects,
    surface rollers, and bottom boundary layer). The coupled system includes the
    three-dimensional coastal circulation GETM and the third generation wind wave
    model SWAN (Simulating Wave Near-shore). I have coupled these models by
    the state-of-the-art model coupling toolkit (MCT), which is the coupler engine
    of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM). This model provides high operational 
    flexibility combining several MPI models to operate simultaneously with
    different numbers of processes by different domain decompositions.           
    I presented the scientific achievements of my fellowship in several scientific
    meetings and in a full length research paper published in the Ocean Modelling
    Journal.
    
    \section{Current Research}
    Since June 2012, I have joined the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric
    Sciences, Oregon State University as a Research Associate, collaborating in
    a multi-institutional ONR project entitled, ``Remote sensing and
    data-assimilative modeling in the littorals (DARLA)''. This collaborative project has been initiated to combine
    pairs of state-of-the-art remote sensing and \textit{in situ} measurements
    with advanced data assimilation (DA) modeling in order to evaluate and improve
    remote sensing retrieval algorithms for environmental parameters, and more
    importantly, infer bathymetry for a range of littoral environments.
    
    In fact, estimation of bathymetry was a primary motivation for the use of data
    assimilation models in the littoral zone, which includes open beaches, river
    mouths, and tidal inlets. While significant progress has been made in
    bathymetry estimation in the surf zone, application to river mouths and tidal
    inlets is still a challenging task, which is my role in this project.
    I have developed an iterative assimilation framework which assimilates surface
    velocity and wave information retrieved from remote sensing instruments 
    (e.g. SAR and X-band radars), and it proved to be a robust method
    for accurate estimation of an evolving bathymetry in a tidal inlet.
    
    I have also studied energy and momentum transfer between
    surface waves and ocean. I am examining turbulent dissipation rate
    measurements of the very thin ocean upper layer, which is gathered by
    floating devices.
    I compare these data with a one-dimensional vertical two-equation turbulence
    model forced by surface flux of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) calculated from wave model
    dissipation sink terms. I am seeking the best turbulence model
    parametrization describing the data, as well as an appropriate wave dissipation
    method in wave model providing correct flux of energy from waves to the ocean.
    We will use this information in our full 3D coupled wave and ocean system
    in real application to improve the quality of simulations. Using our 3D coupled
    model, I am examining at rip-current, surf-zone eddies and near-shore river
    plumes dynamics.
    
    Thus far, I am very satisfied with the progress of my current research and the
    achievements attained at, the College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences,
    and I believe there will be continued research achievements in the immediate
    future.
    
    \section{Future Research}
    I will pursue my research in the field of near-shore and coastal ocean
    hydrodynamical processes. Within the first two years, my short-term plan is to
    continue to work on existing interdisciplinary complex problems using
    computational models and field studies such as:
    \begin{itemize}
         \item \textbf{Application of data assimilation and data-driven machine learning methods:} I will          investigate the use of data assimilation and data-driven machine learning methods to infer different environmental variables (e.g. bathymetry, eddy structure, stratification, bottom roughness, wave dissipation) from their        signatures in new remotely sensed data types (e.g. Airborne SAR and SWOT).

        \item \textbf{Wave-Current interaction:} I will investigate different
        aspects of the wave-current interaction and their role in near-shore and
        open ocean hydrodynamics and define these ranges of applicability and
        accuracy of the methods. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental
        physics of the signatures of different waves-current interaction mechanisms
        and their indicator variables in the environment.
%        \item \textbf{Water column mixing properties}: I will study the effects
        % of dissipated energy from surface waves inside surface and bottom boundary
%        layers on water column mixing properties. Also I will concentrate on
%        improving the dissipation sink terms in wave models to have a
        % consistent flux of energy among atmosphere, surface waves and ocean.
        
        \item  \textbf{Investigate climate change and ongoing transformation
        processes}: I will use the coupled atmosphere-wave-ocean modeling
        framework to study the development of adaptation strategies for
        coastlines and coastal oceans to minimize the economic, social and
        environmental harms.
        
        \item \textbf{Pollution, sediment transport and mixing}: I will study
        the effects of dissipated energy from surface waves inside surface and bottom
        boundary layers on water column mixing properties. Also I will
        concentrate on
        improving the advection and diffusion of sediment and pollution in water
        bodies considering effects of surface waves in eddy diffusivity and mixing
        parametrization and its application in coupled physical$-$biological
        settings for lakes, estuaries and coastal waters.
       \end{itemize}
    
    The research on interdisciplinary complex problems, however, requires the
    collaboration between researchers in several disciplines with a variety of
    tools. Simulations and advanced computational tools can play an important role
    in this collaboration as they are generally faster and have higher
    spatial/temporal resolution than experiments. I believe, however, that the
    modeling results are required to be supported and validated by the
    experimental findings and field observations.        
    
    Thus, with a minimum five-year span, my long term plan is to continue enhancing 
    my state-of-the-art numerical tools to improve their predictive capabilities and
    accuracy in simulating futuristic and developing phenomena. To be able to carry out
    high-resolution simulations of complex coupled models, massive computational
    resources are required. Likewise, further development of my computational
    tools research requires an additional university investment of a smaller, parallel
    cluster, for use by my research group, with approximately 300 additional cores
    at an estimated cost of about $ \$$150K (adjusted per funding availability).
    Ideally, this is in addition to the computational resources currently available
    at the department.         
        
    \section{Research Philosophy}
    My research method is to mathematically challenge and resolve near-shore and
    coastal ocean hydrodynamics, transport and dispersion of tracers in shallow
    coastal waters, and to observe and model turbulence in the surfzone and
    near-shore addressing related problems. Therefore, by analyzing observational
    data and measurements I can improve the numerical tools for more accurate,
    physics-based predictions.
    
    I believe in utilizing more assistance from students in the investigative work
    of research, and therefore I am highly interested in building and leading a team
    of graduate students to:    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Develop state-of-the-art computational tools that can simulate complex
        near-shore hydrodynamics phenomena accurately and efficiently on parallel
        computing clusters.
        \item Apply these tools in interdisciplinary research about near-shore and
        costal ocean hydrodynamics and environmental fluid mechanics to enable
        discovery and advancing knowledge about these important problems.
        \item Perform laboratory/field studies to gain valuable data and insights about
        the wave-current interaction, water column turbulence and mixing properties,
        transport and dispersion of tracers and other missing physics in near-shore
        and coastal seas.
        \item And finally as a major goal, I plan to set up my own research group and
        laboratory as an active part of our department to be a reference laboratory in
        the field of near-shore and coastal ocean hydrodynamics. 
    \end{itemize}
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    I will continue to use state-of-the-art parallel programing tools to develop
    highly scalable computational tools for simulating complex interdisciplinary
     near-shore and coastal ocean hydrodynamics that can lead to discoveries
    and advance knowledge of such phenomena. I will also use experimental and
    oceanographic research facilities to perform experimental and
    observational studies and to obtain physical insight and valuable data to
    validate my simulation results. This approach allows me to collaborate within and across
    different disciplines within the university. I believe that this collaborative
    cooperation of disciplines can lead to profound discoveries which may assist in 
    materializing my vision of establishing a respected reference laboratory in
    near-shore and coastal ocean research with national and international acclaim. 
    Finally, I endeavor to use my research to enhance my teaching methods.
